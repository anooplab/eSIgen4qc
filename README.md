# eSIgen4qc
eSIgen4qc is a tool that generates electronic supporting information (ESI) for quantum chemistry, focusing on ORCA output files. It extracts properties like energy, free energy, zero-point energy (ZPE), and number of imaginary frequencies and presents them in an organized table for convenient reading.
